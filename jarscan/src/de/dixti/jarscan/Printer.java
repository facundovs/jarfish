/**
 * Interface for printing JarResults used by {@link JarScan}. JarScan uses by default
 * the {@link de.dixti.jarscan.core.ConsolePrinter}. You can set your own Printer using {@link JarScan#setPrinter(Printer)}.
 * Usually you do not need an own Printer. In most cases its enough to use the
 * root result that is returned by {@link JarScan#scan()}. Writing your own Printer
 * is useful if you want that every result is printed immediately. JarScan will
 * call printResult(JarResult) any time it scanned a single archive.
